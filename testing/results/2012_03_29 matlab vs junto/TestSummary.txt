This is a test summary for Junto Vs matlab run on the webkb graph from amar.
Preprocesing:
The webkb_amar.mat file was converted to junto format (seperate text files for graph
and correct labels).
The webkb_test_TrunsductionSets.mat file was converted to junto seed and test file.
Specifically the m_optimizationSets first item (out of 1) was converted to be
the transduction set used for the Junto run.

This test was run on Technion Desktop computer, Matlab 2011a.

Results:
********
Matlab and Junto were found to be identical. Junto used 10 iterations, and Matlab used
11 iterations (the first iteration in matlab is just initialization).
Accuracy was compared on junto result (their noted as precision)
against matlab accuracy result on the OPTIMIZATION RUN with all parameters set to 1.
This two runs are run on exactly the same transduction sets, so the should produce
the same results.
Also compared transition probabilities for a few vertices, and results were found
to be identical.
